# Phaser sandbox

[Edit on StackBlitz ⚡️](https://stackblitz.com/edit/phaser-rick2-sandbox)

This is a simple Phaser 3.55.2 typescript sandbox to test features in isolation.

## Rick2 assets

Thanks to [RickDangerous.co.uk](http://www.rickdangerous.co.uk/graphics.htm) for listing the resources since the early 2000's! I simply re-arranged the Vegetablia tiles in `assets/vegetablia.png` to make it usable in Tiled (see `workspace` folder).

See an [example level](https://twitter.com/dercetech/status/1315233303335628800) made for a Phaser rewrite of Rick2.

REM: the port/rewrite was shelved as no agreement could be obtained with the owner of the IP.
